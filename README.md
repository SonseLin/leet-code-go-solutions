Hello

It\`s mine multifile leet project with menu for checking my solutions for leetcode problems<br>
To pick one choose difficulty first and then input any number of task from leetcode<br>
If i complete it, you will find out test output, <br>
if not, you will get a message "i haven\`t done it yet"
